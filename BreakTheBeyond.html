            <h3>System Design</h3>
            <p>I was a system oriented designer in the team, and took responsibility in designing how some of the new
                features worked in game. I also worked in the games first skill tree for the games only hero card at the
                time, the wanderer.
                I also worked on the following features which exist in the game:
            </p>
            <p class="points">
                <li>Daily rewards and extra lives once per day</li>
                <li>Player inventory</li>
                <li>Roguelite relics system, player can gain rewards that they lose if they die</li>
                <li>Swapping items - Player can swap items during a looting phase of a run</li>
            </p>
            <h3 class="">Document Creation</h3>
            <p>
                I aimed to create clear and visual documentation for programmers and artists.
                I gathered feedback of documentation regularly in order to adapt to the teams preferred
                style. Keeping people up to date was important because many of the team members were remote, so I always
                gave a short
                update on main points of documentation.</p>

            <p> The project utilised a spreadsheet to unity workflow (.csv) in maintaining the stats, meaning enemy
                stats would be
                easily transferred from spreadsheets into unity for a faster workflow.
                For more situational features I created quick prototypes using Figma. I also
                occasionally programmed prototypes using Unity C# to illustrate the game feel better on
                major changes to a feature.</p>

        <h3>Swap Mechanic</h3>
        <div class="col-4 row">
            
            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>According to player feedback, players wanted to discard cards from hand in order to have more freedom in
                their playstyle. At the time when player would defeat an enemy and the loot was revealed, they couldn't
                discard cards already in their hand, limiting the amount of loot they can gather.</p>

            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>Instead of just discarding cards into the void, player could swap them while in the looting phase. To
                keep the flow of interaction and to prevent players discarding items by accident during gameplay, we
                opted towards a swapping mechanism instead.
                Player could exchange new cards between loot and hand, giving the possibility to reiterate on their
                choice and strategy according to the visible enemy cards in the background. Player could only swap new
                cards during a battle, but could change their hand fully in a treasure room.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>In retrospective the feature was a good addition, as it allowed meaningful decision making, and showed
                the importance of game flow. It was a challenge to keep things simple and understandable, but in the end
                the feature came out good.

            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
            <p>Sometimes a prototype using assets was more clear than any documentation. Here is an example of an
                in-game shop example, which did not make it to the game.

                    <p>
                        I researched player motivation and Break the beyonds skill tree as part of my thesis. The main
                        goal of the research was to gather data and possible improvement points in the system, and to
                        gather data on player behaviour during soft launch.
                        <br><br>
                        I also wanted to learn different aspects of balancing games by learning from different academic
                        sources in the industry.
                        <br><br>
                        I also wanted to learn and utilize modern testing methods to understand players progression
                        during the game.
                        <br><br>
                        I performed 2 playtest sessions and an online gameplay diary to understand players behaviour
                        better and to analyze possible points of improvement.
